# OpenGL-Framework
An OpenGL framework that wraps basic functions such as shaders, vertex arrays, vertex buffers, index arrays, and textures.

Largely based off [The Cherno's OpenGL series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2)

Uses code from, [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), and [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
